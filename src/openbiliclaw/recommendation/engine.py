# qwen3-vl-embedding (dim=1024). The measured quantity is exactly what this
# bonus computes — per-cover MAX cosine over the text interest anchors.
#
# Two passes, both rule-3 documented:
#  1. GENERIC-ANCHOR pass (scripts/calibrate_visual_thresholds.py, 452 real
#     covers vs 8 generic interest strings): p5=0.183 p25=0.259 p50=0.302
#     p75=0.347 p95=0.403 p99=0.443 p100=0.448. This retired the original
#     0.15/0.45 guess (floor below p5 → ~97% earned bonus; ceil above p100 →
#     none reached full).
#  2. LIVE-ANCHOR pass (the production pool, 834 covers vs the user's ACTUAL
#     soul-profile interest anchors): p5=0.195 p25=0.292 p50=0.350
#     p75=0.408 p95=0.479 p99=0.541 p100=0.598. The distribution sits ~0.05
#     higher than the generic pass because the user's own interest anchors are
#     more on-style for a pool discovered for that user than 8 generic strings.
#     The constants below come from THIS pass — the live distribution is what
#     serve() actually computes, so it is the ground truth, not the generic
#     proxy.
#
# Floor at p50 means ~50% of covers earn some bonus and ~5% reach the cap,
# restoring the discrimination the generic-pass constants (0.30/0.40) had lost
# on the live pool: with those, 71% of covers earned a bonus and 28% were
# pinned at the 0.05 cap, so the top of the ranking collapsed into a flat band
# of 0.88-rel + 0.05-cover ties. Kept small + additive + one-directional;
# exactly 0 when image embedding is inactive. Reopen after any embedding
# provider/model swap (CLAUDE.md pitfall rule 3): rerun the script with
# --reset, and re-derive floor/ceil from the live pool's percentiles once it
# has grown.

# only the warmed subset would systematically favour freshly-discovered items
# over older ones — not because their covers are better, but because the old
# ones simply aren't embedded yet. So serve() withholds the bonus for the whole
# batch until at least this fraction of cover-bearing candidates are warmed; the
# background pool-cover prewarm backfills the rest within a refresh cycle. Delight
# is unaffected (it cold-fetches per candidate, so every item gets its true bonus).

# the user's 2 pos and 3 neg centroids are VISUALLY INTERLEAVED: 2/6 pos×neg
# pairs are "contested" (cosine 0.674 and 0.576, >= 0.40). In a contested region
# a like and a dislike point at the same cover style (love-hate), so the cover
# has no say. We abstain there. Where the cover DOES separate (s_pos - s_neg
# beyond a margin), we boost if the candidate leans liked, suppress if it leans
# disliked. One number on the difference, not two floor/ceil on absolutes —
# self-calibrating because s_pos and s_neg share one embedding/pipeline (the
# 0.80 lesson generalized: absolute thresholds depend on distribution intuition;
# a difference under the same yardstick does not).

# 0.318, 0.219 — separated), with a clean gap between 0.377 and 0.576. 0.45
# sits in that gap: it flags the 2 true overlaps and leaves the 4 separated

# (the safe cold start). Per-polarity, not total: if only likes clear the floor,
# pos centroids are built and neg stays empty -> net = s_pos - 0 -> candidates
# matching liked style boost, nothing suppresses (pure-pos cold start). Symmetric
# for neg-only.
#
# CALIBRATION PROVENANCE: PROVISIONAL — chosen on principle, not yet measured
# against a real feedback-growth curve (rule 3). The 8 lower-bounds the two
# mechanisms that protect centroid quality:
#   - cross_clean_labels uses kNN k=3: it needs >=4 covers per polarity to have
#     3 own_others (below that, kNN clamps to "all of them" and label-noise
#     cleaning is degenerate). 8 gives 7 own_others — kNN fully populated.
#   - build_centroids min_members=2: a 2-cover cluster is a fragile mean. 8 lets
#     cross-clean drop 1-2 strays and still leave a multi-member cluster.
# Live data (12 pos / 22 neg -> 2/3 centroids) is well above this; 8 is ~2/3 of
# the smaller side, leaving headroom for cleaning losses. Reopen once a real

# Video keyframe bonus (P3) — INDEPENDENT of both bonuses above. Compares a

# against the SAME user visual centroids P1 built, so the taste profile matches
# what the video really looks like instead of an UP-chosen marketing cover.
# Frame vectors are max-pooled: "does any sampled frame look like the user's
# taste" is the right question for recall, and max is more sensitive to that
# than a mean that washes out a single strong match.
#
# SCORING: same margin design as P1 (boost/suppress/gray on s_pos - s_neg, with
# contested-pair abstention) — see _VISUAL_PROFILE_* above. P3 reuses P1's
# centroids and the same geometry, so it shares the contested-set and margin.

                expression copy — sharing one limit would starve delight
                scoring whenever the copy queue is short.

        candidates were worse but because Bilibili rows gained a +0.05 channel
        they could never match.

        Per-platform normalization fixes the height while treating zero as a
