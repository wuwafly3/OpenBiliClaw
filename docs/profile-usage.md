# Profile-usage registry

> **Purpose.** One row per surface that consumes the user profile — so that
> per-stage tailoring is deliberate, the portrait boundary is auditable, and no
> new serializer fork appears by accident. Seeded from the profile-views spec
> (`docs/plans/2026-07-18-profile-views-spec.md` §D1–D8) and the 2026-07-16
> token-diet audit. Every `file:line` below was cross-checked against the working
> tree. Task 5 (Wave B) relocated the three content-pipeline serializers into
> `soul/profile_views.py`; `discovery/strategies/_utils.py` now re-exports them.

## The serialization paths

The profile reaches an LLM prompt through a small set of serializers. Content-pipeline
serializers live in `soul/profile_views.py` (`discovery/strategies/_utils.py` keeps
re-export stubs so every legacy import path stays valid):

| Serializer | Defined at | Shape | Portrait? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `build_profile_summary` | `soul/profile_views.py` (re-export `discovery/strategies/_utils.py`) | dict | **No** | Canonical structured profile; portrait deliberately excluded. `favorite_up_users` also excluded. |
| `compact_content_prompt_profile_summary` | `soul/profile_views.py` (re-export `_utils`) | dict | **No** | Caps a `build_profile_summary` dict for ranker / recommendation expression (20 core / 48 interests / 32×16 domains / 12 recent; dislike floor preserved). |
| `compact_gate_evaluation_profile_summary` | `soul/profile_views.py` (re-export `_utils`) | dict | **No** | Same compact caps, then drops `recent_awareness` / `active_insights` / `speculative_interests`. Aliased as `compact_evaluation_profile_summary` in `discovery/engine.py`. |
| `build_query_generation_profile_summary` | `soul/profile_views.py` (re-export `_utils`) | dict | **No** | Query-trimmed taste shape; drops awareness/insights/timestamps. Interests cap 64, domains ≤16. |
| `build_cognition_profile_view_v1` / `CognitionProfileViewV1` | `soul/profile_views.py` | stable soul + stable preference + volatile cognition | **Yes, when soul is supplied** | Named, uncapped cognition-only projection. Removes storage/init bookkeeping and the duplicate `soul.interest` subtree, filters archived positive interests, preserves negative evidence and unknown semantic fields, and splits recent awareness/active insights from the stable prefix. Awareness/Insight historically received the full soul snapshot, including `personality_portrait`, so compact-v1 deliberately preserves it. Preference does not supply a soul snapshot. |
| `speculation` (→ `to_llm_context(include_portrait=False)`) | `soul/profile_views.py` (`speculation`); renderer `soul/profile.py:720` (onion) / `:115` (flat) | str | **No** (opted out) | String view for the two speculator prompts. Task 7 collected the former in-line `to_llm_context(include_portrait=False)` fork into a façade view that delegates to the profile's own renderer (zero behaviour change). `include_portrait=True` default still keeps the portrait for eval/persona rendering (not this path). |
| `chat_core_memory` / `render_core_memory_blocks` | `soul/profile_views.py` (`chat_core_memory`), `memory/manager.py` (`render_core_memory_blocks` / `render_core_memory_prompt`) | `(stable, volatile)` str pair | **Yes** (stable block) | Chat core-memory view. Reads the **effective** profile (AI ⊕ overrides via `_effective_soul_data`, `manager.py`), so manual edits show. `complete_with_core_memory` injects `stable_block` (portrait/identity/preference) into system and `volatile_block` (awareness/insights) ahead of the user turn — awareness churn no longer breaks the cached system prefix (Task 6). `render_core_memory_prompt` kept as the concatenated compat wrapper for non-chat readers. |
| `ProfileResponse` (Agent Bridge) | `integrations/openclaw/schemas.py` + `operations.py:get_profile` | dataclass | **Yes** (intentional) | External Agent Bridge surface; portrait is deliberately re-exposed and each list is capped at five items. |

`CognitionEventViewV1` lives in `soul/event_prompt_views.py`. It is the matching
event projection, not a profile serializer: it preserves event order/count and
semantic evidence, parses metadata deterministically, and removes only an
explicit narrow set of transport/projection bookkeeping fields.

## Consumer surfaces

| Preference analysis (`soul.preference*`) | Init, event chunk, or feedback batch | `build_preference_analysis_prompt(..., input_view=...)`; `compact-v1` uses `CognitionEventViewV1` + `CognitionProfileViewV1.stable_preference` | Event count/order and semantic evidence preserved; profile/event bookkeeping removed; awareness/insight context remains uncapped when supplied | No (no soul snapshot supplied) | Yes |
| Plain awareness (`soul.awareness`) | Legacy direct awareness analysis | `build_awareness_prompt(..., input_view="legacy")` in production; compact seam exists only for controlled replay | Full legacy soul/preference/events | Yes (historical full soul) | Yes |

## Portrait boundary (invariant)

`personality_portrait` is prohibited from content-pipeline prompt serializers.
It remains intentional on these established surfaces:

- **Chat core memory** (`render_core_memory_prompt` → `complete_with_core_memory`).
- **Cognition awareness/insight** — their legacy prompts already consumed the
  complete soul snapshot; `CognitionProfileViewV1.stable_soul` preserves the
  portrait so compact-v1 does not silently change interpretation. Preference
  compact does not receive a soul snapshot.
- **Agent Bridge external `ProfileResponse`** (`operations.py:get_profile`) — plus UI
  (`/api/profile-summary`) and eval personas, which are out of the profile-views
  scope but keep the portrait by design.

Every content-pipeline serializer (`build_profile_summary`,
`compact_content_prompt_profile_summary`,
`compact_gate_evaluation_profile_summary`,
`build_query_generation_profile_summary`, the `speculation` view →
`to_llm_context(include_portrait=False)`) MUST exclude it. Enforced by
`tests/test_profile_views_guards.py`.

## Maintenance-caller injection audit (Task 8)

Per-caller decision for the eight `complete_structured_task` /
`complete_with_core_memory` sites that inherited the default core-memory
injection. **Opt-out** = added `inject_core_memory=False`; **keep** = documented
in-code as intentionally core-memory-bearing.

| Call site | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `soul/consolidator.py:814` | opt-out | Merge/keep judged purely from the interest-label cluster payload; portrait irrelevant to whether two labels denote the same interest. |
| `soul/layer_updaters.py:324` (role) | keep | Role-layer self-update; injected "who the user is" context helps connect new evidence to the user's life stage. |
| `soul/layer_updaters.py:423` (values) | keep | Values-layer delta; core context legitimately informs whether a value should be added/removed (author-curated 用户背景 confirms the intent). |
| `soul/layer_updaters.py:538` (core) | keep | Deepest core layer under strongest diff protection; core context helps weigh whether evidence justifies a change. |
| `soul/category_migration.py:145` | opt-out | Pure taxonomy canonicalization of category labels; no user-specific judgment. |
| `soul/pool_purge.py:201` | opt-out | Dislike-match judgment fully specified by the user prompt (new dislikes + all dislikes + candidates). |
| `soul/dialogue_insight_analyzer.py:70` | opt-out | The prompt already serializes the full `core_memory` dict into the user message; injection was an exact duplicate. Model still sees core memory via the explicit param. |
| `api/app.py:6244` (probe sentiment) | keep | Chat-adjacent sentiment classification; reading tone in the user's own context is desirable. |

Guarded by `tests/test_maintenance_injection_audit.py` (pool purge + dialogue
insight), `tests/test_profile_consolidator.py::test_consolidation_judge_opts_out_of_core_memory_injection`,
and `tests/test_category_migration.py::test_category_mapping_opts_out_of_core_memory_injection`.
